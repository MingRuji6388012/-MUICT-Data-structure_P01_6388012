###TO-DO
1) Go to `SortVisualiser.java`
2) Run the program
3) Panel (sorting visualizer window) will automatically appear
4) Program will ask you to input the number to do the specific task(s).
   
          0 - To print choice options.
          1 - To add Merge sort algorithm into the waiting list
          2 - To add Selection sort algorithm into the waiting list
          3 - To add Insertion sort algorithm into the waiting list
          4 - To add Bubble sort algorithm into the waiting list
          5 - To remove the element from the list by the given index
          6 - To visualize algorithms which you added respectively
          7 - To end the program
5) To visualize the algorithm you customize, press 6 to perform, then go to Panel to watch your result!
